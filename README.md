# RAG-System-
A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system enhancing LLM responses with optimized text chunking, vector search (FAISS/ChromaDB), and response validation. Built using LangChain and GPT models, it ensures high accuracy by evaluating coherence, relevance, and readability for scalable NLP applications.


Features:
Text Chunking: Implements various chunking strategies (fixed-length, semantic, recursive) for better retrieval.
Vector Search: Uses FAISS and ChromaDB to store and retrieve relevant document chunks efficiently.
Response Validation: Evaluates coherence, relevance, and readability to refine LLM outputs.
Modular & Scalable: Built with LangChain and GPT models, making it easy to extend for different use cases.
